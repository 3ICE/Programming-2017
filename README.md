# Daniel Berezvai's repo for Programming 2017.
Find my lecture notes, homework, and exercise group work at my website; <http://tut.3ice.hu/Programming/> or in this very repo:
* <https://gitlab.rd.tut.fi/tie-02206-basic-course-on-programming_k2017/262849/tree/master> (no lecture notes here, just the homework and exercise group projects)
* Homework is submitted every week to gitlab. (Usually on Wednesdays) I also submit my exercise group projects even though they are not required.
* Assignments are at **http://www.cs.tut.fi/kurssit/TIE-02206/K2017/@template.html?viikkoharjoitukset.html**
* My results are [here](https://www.cs.tut.fi/~basic/K2017/@template.html?omasivu.html) (Login required, so only accessible by me. You will instead see your own results, if you have them.)
