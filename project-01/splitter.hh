/** Minified Splitter class from weekly-assignment-03 (a split tool,
 * implementing a class Splitter, which has a suitable public
 * interface to do splitting related operations)
 *
 * @note This time I'm going to put all function documentation in the
 * other file. (splitter.cpp)
 * @see splitter.cpp
 *
 * @question Does this comment block go inside the include guard or
 * is it okay to place it above? The generated source will contain
 * this comment more than once. But comments are not included in the
 * linking process anyway. No major side effect either way.
